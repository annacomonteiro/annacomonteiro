# 🌎 Hi there! I'm Anna Monteiro  
👩‍🔬 Environmental Engineer (almost there), technology enthusiast, and climate problem-solver and researcher.  
💼 Currently Executive Analyst at Eldredge Consulting (USA).

I'm currently pursuing a degree in Environmental Engineering at UFF and I'm passionate about blending science, sustainability, and technology to create practical and innovative solutions. I've worked on projects ranging from climate mapping using Python and Jupyter Notebook to 3D modeling. I even took a deep dive into Harvard's CS50 course, where I sharpened my logic and programming skills in C, Python, and Lua.

Now I navigate through environmental data analysis, project management, and a wide range of tools that keep me focused on efficiency and continuous learning.

💡 **Interests**: sustainability, data science, climate change, tech innovation, and research.  
🗣️ **Languages**: Portuguese, English, Spanish, French.  
📬 **Want to chat or collaborate?** Reach out at: [anna.oliveiramonteiro@gmail.com](mailto:anna.oliveiramonteiro@gmail.com)  
🎯 **You can count on me to** turn ideas into real impact — consciously and creatively connecting technology and the environment.

🎨 **Fun fact:**  
Besides all that, I'm also an artist in my spare time — whether on paper or digitally — and a fashion sketch designer!  
And yes, my 3D models are solid, but my clay sculptures? Equally impressive.  
My creativity is multi-format... so I can *create* my own multiverse!
